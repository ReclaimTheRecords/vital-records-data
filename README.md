# Vital Records Data

This repository contains files related to vital records access and restrictions in the US, including how open records relate to reported identity theft. (Hint: they don't. The vast majority of identity theft has nothing to do with genealogical records.)

This data compilation and graphing is the work of genealogists Alec Ferretti and Alex Calzareth. The state vital records data was sourced from official state websites, and the identity theft data was sourced from the FTC: https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/consumer-sentinel-network
